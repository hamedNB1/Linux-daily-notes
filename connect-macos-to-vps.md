# Connect macOS Terminal to Ubuntu VPS

This guide explains how to connect your macOS Terminal to an Ubuntu VPS using SSH.  
It also includes optional SSH key setup, changing your VPS password, and troubleshooting tips.

---

## Prerequisites
- VPS IP address
- SSH username (usually `root` or a custom user)
- Password or SSH key
- macOS Terminal

---

## Step 1: Open Terminal
Press `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, and press Enter.

---

## Step 2: Connect via SSH

Use the following command format:

```bash
ssh username@server_ip
```
Example:
```
ssh root@123.456.78.90
```
On first connection, you may see:
```
The authenticity of host '123.456.78.90 (123.456.78.90)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
Type yes and press Enter to continue.
```

Step 3: Enter Password
After running the SSH command, you will be prompted for your VPS password:
```
username@server_ip's password:
```
Type your password (characters will not show for security) and press Enter.
Once entered correctly, you will be logged into your VPS.

Step 4: Optional - SSH Key Setup (Password-less Login)

Generate a key pair (if you donâ€™t have one already):
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```
Copy your public key to the VPS:
```
ssh-copy-id username@server_ip
```
Connect without a password:
```
ssh username@server_ip
```

---

Step 5: Change VPS Password

Command to change password:
```
passwd
```
You will be prompted to enter the current password. Then enter your new password and confirm it.
Password must meet VPS security requirements (usually at least 8 characters).

Example:
```
Current password:
New password:
Retype new password:
passwd: password updated successfully
```
Tips & Best Practices

Use SSH keys for secure, password-less login.

Keep your private key safe (~/.ssh/id_rsa).

Avoid using root for regular tasks; create a sudo user.

Consider changing the default SSH port for better security.

Always use strong, unique passwords.
