# 2. List Only Open (Visible) Applications
```
wmctrl -l
```
If you donâ€™t have wmctrl:
```
sudo dnf install wmctrl -y
```
Shows all currently open windows.
# 3. Open an Application
```
firefox &
gnome-terminal &
nautilus &
```
The "&" lets the app run in the background so the terminal stays usable.
# 4. Close (Quit) an Application
Find the process and kill it:
```
ps aux | grep firefox
kill <PID>
```
or more simply:
```
pkill firefox
```
